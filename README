BACKGROUND
------------

Apache Accumulo [0] has a simple test suite that verifies that data is not lost
at scale.  This test suite is called continuous ingest.  This test runs many
ingest clients that continually create linked lists containing 25 million
nodes. At some point the clients are stopped and a map reduce job is run to
ensure no linked list has a hole. A hole indicates data was lost.  

The nodes in the linked list are random.  This causes each linked list to
spread across the table.  Therefore if one part of a table loses data, then it
will be detected by references in another part of the table.

This project is a version of the test suite written using Apache Gora [1].
Goraci has been tested against Accumulo and HBase.  

THE ANATOMY OF GORACI TESTS
----------------------------

Below is rough sketch of how data is written.  For specific details look at the
Generator code (src/main/java/goraci/Generator.java)

  1 Write out 1 million nodes 
  2 Flush 
  3 Write out 1 million that reference previous million 
  4 If this is the 25th set of 1 million nodes, then update 1st set of million
    to point to last 
  5 goto 1

The key is that nodes only reference flushed nodes.  Therefore a node should
never reference a missing node, even if the ingest client is killed at any
point in time.

When running this test suite w/ Accumulo there is a script running in parallel
called the Aggitator that randomly and continuously kills server processes.  
The outcome was that many data loss bugs were found in Accumulo by doing this. 
This test suite can also help find bugs that impact uptime and stability when 
run for days or weeks.  

This test suite consists the following 
- a few Java programs 
- a little helper script to run the java programs
- a maven script to build it.  

BUILDING GORACI
---------------

This code currently depends on an unreleased version of Gora.  To build Gora
0.2 run the following commands.

  svn export http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gora/trunk gora
  cd gora
  mvn install -DskipTests

After this you can build goraci.

  git clone git://github.com/keith-turner/goraci.git
  cd goraci
  mvn compile

The maven pom file has some profiles that attempt to make it easier to run
goraci against different gora backends by copying the jars you need into lib.
Before packaging its important to edit gora.properties and set it correctly for
your datastore.  To run against accumulo do the following.

  vim src/main/resources/gora.properties
  mvn package -Paccumulo-1.4

To run against hbase, do the following.

  vim src/main/resources/gora.properties
  mvn package -Phbase-0.92

For other backends like cassandra, you will need to copy the appropriate deps
into lib.  Feel free to update the pom with other profiles and send me pull
request.

GORA AND HADOOP
-----------------

Gora uses Avro which uses a Json library that Hadoop has an old version of.
The two libraries  jackson-core and jackson-mapper need to be updated in
<HADOOP_HOME>/lib and <HADOOP_HOME>/share/hadoop/lib/.  I updated these to
jackson-core-asl-1.4.2.jar and jackson-mapper-asl-1.4.2.jar.  For details see
HADOOP-6945 [3]. 

GORACI AND HBASE
-----------------

There are currently two issues that must be addressed to make Goraci run with
HBase.

First, inorder to make Goraci ingest quickly into HBase, the gora-hbase
datastore code must be modified to disable autoflush.  This change was made in
the following git repo.

  https://github.com/ericnewton/gora
  
Second, the generator needs to be scaled back from 1,000,000 inserts at a time
to 100,000 or it will hang for some unknown reason.  This can be accomplished
by modifing a constant in goraci.Generator and rebuilding.

JAVA CLASS DESCRIPTION
-----------------

Below is a description of the Java programs

  * goraci.Generator - A map only job that generates data.
  * goraci.Verify    - A map reduce job that looks for holes.  Look at the
                       counts after running.  REFERENCED and UNREFERENCED are 
                       ok, any UNDEFINED counts are bad. Do not run at the 
                       same time as the Generator.
  * goraci.Walker    - A standalong program that start following a linked  list 
                       and emits timing info.  
  * goraci.Print     - A standalone program that prints nodes in the linked list
  * goraci.Delete    - A standalone program that deletes a single node

goraci.sh is a helper script that you can use to run the above programs.  It
assumes all needed jars are in the lib dir.  It does not need the package name.
You can just run "./goraci.sh Generator", below is an example.

  $ ./goraci.sh Generator
  Usage : Generator <num mappers> <num nodes>

For Gora to work, it needs a gora.properties file on the classpath and a
mapping file on the classpath, the contents of both are datastore specific,
more details can be found here [2]. You can edit the ones in src/main/resources
and build the goraci-${version}-SNAPSHOT.jar with those. Alternatively remove
those and put them on the classpath through some other means.

CONCLUSIONS
------------

This test suite does not do everything that the Accumulo test suite does,
mainly it does not collect statistics and generate reports.  The reports
are useful for assesing performance.

Below shows running a test of the test.  Ingest one linked list, deleted a node
in it, ensure the verifaction map reduce job notices that the node is missing.
Not all output is shown, just the important parts.

  $ ./goraci.sh Generator  1 25000000
  $ ./goraci.sh Print -s 2000000000000000 -l 1

The map reduce job found the one undefined node and gave the node that
referenced it.

Below are some timing statistics for running goraci on a 10 node cluster. For
Accumulo 1 billion nodes were generated and verified.  For HBase 100 million
nodes were generated and verified.

  Store           | Task                   | Time    | Undef  | Unref | Ref

  accumulo-1.4.0  | Verify /tmp/goraci1 19 |  9m 36s |      0 |     0 | 1000000000

  hbase-0.92.1    | Verify /tmp/goraci2 40 | 33m 22s |      0 |     0 |  100000000  

For the accumulo run, the table was presplit into 8 tablets using the following
command in the accumulo shell.  This was done before the generator was started.

  addsplits -t ci \x10 \x20 \x30 \x40 \x50 \x60 \x70
